### Data Control & Privacy

Unlike cloud services, Expensica gives you complete ownership of your data.

- All data stored locally in your vault (inside a folder named "expensica-data")
- Simple JSON format anyone can read
- No internet connection required
- Back up your data however you prefer

## Practical Usage

Here's how I use Expensica daily:

1. **Morning review**: I check yesterday's expenses and my month-to-date balance
2. **Throughout the day**: Quick-add expenses with the hotkey as they happen
3. **Weekly review**: I use the calendar view to spot expense patterns
4. **Monthly planning**: I export last month's data and plan my budget

The key is adding expenses immediately. The friction in most tracking systems is remembering to log expenses later. With Expensica right in Obsidian where you're already working, you remove that friction.

## Limitations (Being Honest)

Expensica isn't trying to be everything. It doesn't:

- Connect to bank accounts or import transactions automatically
- Handle investments or complex accounting
- Support multiple currencies in a single transaction
- Provide tax preparation features
- Offer budget forecasting

If you need these features, you might want a more complex financial system. Expensica is for people who want something simple, fast, and private.

## Technical Details

For the curious:

- Transactions are stored in `expensica-data/transactions.json`
- Settings and categories in your regular Obsidian settings
- Everything renders in real-time‚Äîno lag, no waiting
- Uses standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

## The Philosophy

Most finance apps get it backward. They try to do too much and end up doing nothing well. Expensica started with a single goal: make tracking income and expenses as frictionless as possible while keeping your data completely private.

Great tools don't try to be everything. They do one thing extremely well. A hammer doesn't try to be a screwdriver. Excel doesn't try to be Word.

Expensica doesn't try to be your entire financial system. It's just the best way to track your daily finances inside Obsidian.
